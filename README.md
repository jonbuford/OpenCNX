# OpenCNX
OpenCNX Connection Standard for Modular Control Systems

The OpenCNX standard is for defining the interfaces between modules in a microcontroller system developed for automation. 
The first interfaces are: 

OpenCNX 164 - Used for connecting a microcontroller to an 8 function module backplane (at least that is the first use).

OpenCNX 34 - Function Module interface that combines both power and communication in a useful way. Think of Arduino or Raspberry Pi shields/hats with high voltage and current available. It also includes a system sync for supporting microcontrollers on the modules for things like advanced motion control.

This has initially been developed by Apparatus as part of the Atomotion line, but the intent is for it to be open for everyone to work with.
